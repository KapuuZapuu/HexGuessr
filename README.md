# HexGuessr
I'm not done yet please bear with me :)

Notes for self:
- hitbox for icons needs to be consistent w/ hover mechanic
- daily/unlimited buttons need indicators for when they're clicked in both light and dark mode (dark grey in light and white in dark)
- resized windows (200+%) need to be satisfactory: header order-- 1. title, 2. mode btns and icons.
animation pause needs to remove color from title, and stop hover mechanic from all items.
- The yellow squares need white font
- Grid should be slightly bigger-- more spacing between individual rows/guesses
- hashtag on the left of the grid should be bigger
- delete button should have a custom pixelated icon instead of the current placeholder
- keyboard should be in its own container, and have its keys being a smaller size (both the keys and the font inside) to the actual grid to develop some distinction between the two elements. Color as well maybe?
