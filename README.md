I'm not done yet please bear with me :)

Notes for self:
- hitbox for icons needs to be consistent w/ hover mechanic
- daily/unlimited buttons need indicators for when they're clicked in both light and dark mode (dark grey in light and white in dark)
- resized windows (200+%) need to be satisfactory: header order-- 1. title, 2. mode btns and icons.
animation pause needs to remove color from title, and stop hover mechanic from all items.
