# HexGuessr
I'm not done yet please bear with me :)

Notes for self:
- hitbox for icons needs to be consistent w/ hover mechanic
- daily/unlimited buttons need indicators for when they're clicked in both light and dark mode (dark grey in light and white in dark)
- resized windows (200+%) need to be satisfactory: header order-- 1. title, 2. mode btns and icons.
animation pause needs to remove color from title, and stop hover mechanic from all items.
- The yellow squares need white font
- Grid should be slightly bigger-- more spacing between individual rows/guesses
- hashtag on the left of the grid should be bigger
- delete button should have a custom pixelated icon instead of the current placeholder
- keyboard should be in its own container, and have its keys being a smaller size (both the keys and the font inside) to the actual grid to develop some distinction between the two elements. Color as well maybe?
- inputting a guess while the hidden color is revealed (and the timer bar is actuated and going) causes for some weird things to happen. gotta figure out how to stop the logic from conflicting with one another
